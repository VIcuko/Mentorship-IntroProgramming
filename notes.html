    <h1>Web Programming Basics</h1>

    <b>The World Wide Web</b>
    <p>
      The web is composed largely of HTML documents. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the language the browsers use to interpret web pages. The components of the web include the client (your computer and browser), the Internet, and servers. The client and servers interact through something called the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    </p>

    <b>HTML Basic Elements</b>
    <p>
      HTML elements are what we use to tell a web browser how to display content on a web page.
      Most HTML elements consist of an opening and a closing tag with some content between them to for instance make a word <b>bold</b> or be written in <em>italics</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may as well introduce different content in blocks of different types, such as an inline or not. So, by using the tag div tag, we introduce a content into a block, whilst using the span tag it remains inline: <span>This is a span</span>
      <div>This is a div</div>
    </p>

    <b>HTML Basic Attributes</b>
    <p>
      Some elements accept additional values called attributes in their opening tags. Attributes provide additional information to the browser. For example, the anchor tag takes an attribute called href that defines a URL to link to.

      So for instance, by defining the href parameter in the anchor tag, you can build a link like this <a href="www.udacity.com">one</a>
      And by defining the src parameter in the image tag, you can define the source where the image is located in order to show it directly in your website:
      <img src="https://d125fmws0bore1.cloudfront.net/assets/udacity_share-317a7f82552763598a5c91e1550b7cd83663ce02d6d475d703e25a873cd3b574.png" alt="Image" style="width:200px; height:100px">
    </p>
    <b>More information</b>
    <p>
      There is a whole lot of information in the web, although for beginning in the HTML programming world, the following are some useful websites that containt a lot of documentation on HTML tags and any other matter related:
