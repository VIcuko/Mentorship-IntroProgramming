        		At that time I was working as a consultant for a big international company 24/7.
        		My job required traveling to many different places and working with many people from varied cultures. At first I really liked the idea of traveling and working with other people, but in the long term it became bulky and the weight began to increase since I had less and less time for myself and my beloved ones, what's even more, spending time with my family was seen as something negative by my boss... something I never quite understood.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		After that, I began to think of ways to leave my current lifestyle and embark in a new adventure with my partner in life.And so we went on, into the undiscovered...

								And so the journey begins. I left it all, I left everything behind and started a new journey with my partner in life. We betted all in and now is the time to see if we won or not. It's the time to master ourselved, to discover who we really are and what we are capable of of. It's the time to leave behind all opinions and focus on our own. It's the moment to grow in mind and spirit. Let it begin.

								First destination, the pirenees. The unexpected mountains between France and Spain. A place of peace and mindfulness.

								At last, after several hours of train and bus combined, we arrived at Benasque. A spiritual and unique place next to the border with France, hidden between the immense forests and the rocky landscapes. Here we were received by a wonderful local, someone whose family lived in this beautiful town for generations so long ago, that they were the first ones to live in the valley. Accompanied by such wonderful person came along lots of knowledge and information regarding every inch of the valley, every detail every species of animals and lots of wonderful experience that could make anyone dive deep into the spirit of the mountains.

								Here we are. In the most experienced house of the valley. The house that has lived the joy and sadness of several generations. The place that has seen how more people arrived to stop feeling lonely. The house that if it could speak could tell us stories until we grew old.

								Such a wonderful experience in a place full of magic and kindness. A fantastic place to begin the journey to one self.

								After a phase of self insight and relaxation, come the first steps to a new life. We headed to the eastern coast of Spain to a magnificent environment, full of wonders and light. Hidden spaces behind every corner and under every rock in the path.

								Butterflies flying all around the beautiful colors of the wind between every plant on the way. Here is where I begin to realize that this journey is worth everythin I've betted on.

								It's a lot more than I expected and will definitely continue growing into something new and full of energy.
